At the time of admission to our hospital unit, physical examination was completely negative. Routine blood analysis showed anemia (Ht: 32.8 %, Hb: 11.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis (452 000 platelets/mL), high ESR (124 mm/h), low plasma albumin (3.05 g/dL), and high levels of IgA (1 100 mg/dL) and IgM (369 mg/dL) with no monoclonal component. The patient also had low ferritin (<9 mg/mL) and tetrahydrofolate levels (1.9 ng/ml; normal range 3-17 ng/mL). A coagulation study showed the presence of lupus anticoagulant. Enzyme studies confirmed a remarkable increase of serum amylase (1 196 IU/L), pancreatic isoamylase fraction (798 IU/ L), and serum lipase (1 650 IU/L). On the other hand, urinary amylase excretion was normal (120, normal value <1 500 IU/ day), and ultrasound examination of the pancreas was normal. A chromatographic assay was therefore performed at another Institution (Ospedali Riuniti, Padova, Italy), which demonstrated the presence of macroamylasemia and macrolipasemia.
