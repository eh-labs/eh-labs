Eight daysafter admission to hospital and while on prednisone 60 mg daily the patient developed a rapid rise in intraocular pressure in the left eye to 40 mmHg along with 5 mm proptosis, a conjunctival purulent discharge, and the rapid onset of a dense cataract. Computerised tomography showed no evidence of a lesion to explain the proptosis. Orbital cellulitis was suspected, and nafcillin 12 g/day plus gentamicin 80 mg every eight hours was given intravenously along with topical neomycin-polymixin B (Neosporin) and dexamethasone. The ocular tension was controlled with acetazolamide 1 g orally daily and timolol 0-5% topically. Conjunctival cultures were negative for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria.
