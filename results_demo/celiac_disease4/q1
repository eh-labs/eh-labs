A 20-year-old female collegiate tennis player presented in the athletic medicine facility on October 14, 2001, complaining of diffuse myalgia centered in her midback. Her height was 162.5 cm and her mass was 58.2 kg. Her father’s height was 182.9 cm; her mother’s, 172.2 cm; and her sister’s, 175.3 cm. Vital signs were temperature of 98.28F, respirations of 13 per minute, and blood pressure of 118/76 mm Hg. The subject had severe eczema in 1996 and mononucleosis in 2000. In April 2001, she developed arthralgia, myalgia, chronic diarrhea, and profound fatigue. She saw her pediatrician in May 2001 and was referred to an allergist, who found negative reactions to a multitude of substances. Because of her symptom severity and persistence, the athlete was referred for further, more specific testing. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was conducted in July 2001. This assay tests the patient’s blood for antibodies to specific substances (antigens). The patient showed positive reactions to gluten, spelt (a member of the same grain family as wheat and oats but an entirely different species), albumin, lactose, barley, and rye, as well as other wheat-based substances.
