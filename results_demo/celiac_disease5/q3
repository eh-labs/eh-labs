Our patient had iron-deficient anemia, which was refractory to oral iron supplementation, a well known presenting sign, together with low albumin and tetrahydrofolate levels. In addition, she had macroamylasemia and macrolipasemia. Therefore, a search was performed for circulating anti-gliadin, anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies. Detection of these antibodies led us to perform upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and duodenal biopsy.
