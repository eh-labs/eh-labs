He was diagnosed with UC with primary sclerosing cholangitis at age of 14 following chronic diarrhea, weight loss, guaiac positive stools, and elevated GGT. The colonoscopy then showed pancolitis extending throughout the colon with no evidence of granuloma. Liver biopsy showed onion skinning around the bile ducts. He was initially treated with steroids, mesalamine, and ursodiol. His last flare was a year ago. He had 4-5 blood streaked loose stools per day treated with tapering dose of steroids. Since then he has had no further UC flare and has been on mesalamine and ursodiol.
