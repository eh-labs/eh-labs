On 15 July 1982 a 45-year-old woman from Westchester County, New York, developed severe headache, light headedness, chills, and fever. Three days later she also had nausea and vomiting. On 21 July she noted red lesions on her right foot and upper arms that looked like insect bites. In addition a large annular erythema with an indurated centre was noted on the right thigh. This lesion expanded and developed a bright red outer border with central clearing. She remembered having been bitten by many flying insects during the 4 July weekend but recalled no tick bites. She was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg four times a day and a cortisone skin ointment for what was thought to be a local skin allergy to insect bites. On 30 July, because of daily fevers, malaise, and skin lesions, she was admitted to a community hospital. A physician removed fragments of a presumed insect stringer from her right foot accompanied by a white mucoid discharge. Herwhite blood cell count was 22 x 109/l with 73% polymorphonuclear leucocytes and 18% band forms, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 48 mm/h. She was treated empirically with intravenous cefazolin, 6 g a day for seven days, but continued to have daily fevers up to 40- 10C (104-20F). She was then changed to oral tetracycline, 500 mg four times a day for seven more days. She responded well to this regimen.
