Urinalysis showed glomerular proteinuria (0.7 g/day), microscopic hematuria, hyaline and granular casts; creatinine clearance (74 mL/min) was reduced with respect to the patientâ€™s age. These results raised the suspicion of IgA nephropathy, but the patient did not consent to undergo kidney biopsy. HLA analysis revealed the presence of HLA DQB1*-02.
