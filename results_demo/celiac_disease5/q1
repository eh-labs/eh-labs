A 34 years old, non drinker, non smoking woman, was admitted to the third Medical Clinic, Careggi University Hospital, Florence because of hyper-amilasemia and hyper-lipasemia of unknown origin. The patient had acute meningitis at the age of three. At age of 23, she was admitted to hospital because of syncope, referred to acute gastroenteritis complicated by metabolic acidosis; laboratory evaluation performed on that occasion showed iron deficient anemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), reduced C3 levels and circulating antinuclear antibodies (1:80), that led to suspicion of a not otherwise specified collagen disease. Iron deficiency was unresponsive to supplement of oral iron, while it improved following intravenous therapy. The patient had two spontaneous abortions when aged 30 and 31 years, respectively, both at the 16 th week of gestation. During admission because of the second abortion, a thorough investigation was performed that was negative for potential causes of fetal demise, including fasting glucose, basal FSH, LH and estradiol levels on day 3 of a natural cycle, TSH and prolactin levels, antinuclear antibodies, antibodies against infectious agents, hysterosalpingography and genetic karyotyping of the couple. On that occasion, she was found to have hyperamilasemia and hyperlipasemia, together with the previously reported laboratory alterations; so further investigations were performed including CT, which turned out to be negative for any pancreatic disease.
