The abdominal CT scan showed several jejunal mesenteric enlarged lymph nodes. The chest CT scan showed an aspecific pulmonary nodule of 1,7 cm in the right lung. The 18F- Fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT showed a hypermetabolic activity of the pulmonary 
nodule, of a nodular formation in the left upper quadrant and along the duodenum. The 18F-FDG-labeled leukocyte PET/CT (in investigation in our institution) did not show any deep seated lesions with increased uptake. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 1/10 in the right eye and 7/10 in the left eye. Ocular pressure was normal. The slit-lamp examination showed signs of intraocular inflammation in both eyes. The anterior segment showed inflammatory cells in suspension in the aqueous humour, bilateral white granulomatous retrocorneal precipitates and bilateral active iridocrystalline synechiae. Investigation of the posterior segment showed vitritis.
