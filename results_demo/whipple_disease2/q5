The blood analysis revealed a CRP at level of 34 mg/dl and a count of 20 400 white blood cells/mm3 with 90% of neutrophils. Renal function and liver enzymes were normal. Others parameters were not helpful. Chest X-ray was normal. Urine culture was negative. Despite the presence of a major inflammatory state which is unusual in systemic non-infectious inflammatory diseases but more usual in infectious diseases, the first diagnostic hypothesis was an inflammatory disease. The duration of the symptoms also plaided for a non-infectious inflammatory disease. The patient did not fulfill Behçet’s criteria but his condition had responded previously to methotrexate. Thus, at first, we increased the immunosuppressive therapy, without empiric antibiotherapy. Prednisolone doses were increased to 60 mg/day. Ciclosporin was maintained at a daily dose of 450 mg. Sulfasalazine was introduced at a daily dose of 1 g. Methotrexate was reintroduced at a weekly dose of 15 mg. In the same time, supplementary examinations were performed to exclude an infectious disease and to establish a diagnosis.
