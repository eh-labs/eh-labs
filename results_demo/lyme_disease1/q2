Two weeks later, on 25 August 1982, a sting on the left thigh by a bee caused local erythema. Two days afterwards she awoke with a painful red left eye. She had no eye complaints previously. The patient treated herself with sulphafurazole (sulfisoxazone) drops, but sought an ophthalmologist when the vision decreased in the left eye and periorbital oedema developed. She was noted to have iritis and posterior synechiae and was treated with topical atropine 1% and Predforte 1% (dexamethasone) drops, with resultant breaking of the synechiae. However, the iritis persisted, and despite subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone 40 mg hypopyon developed along with vitritis. Oral prednisone 60 mg per day was begun. The visual acuity nevertheless worsened, and the prednisone dose was increased to 100 mg daily. She was then transferred to Westchester County Medical Center.
