Clinical examination revealed left eye ecchymosis, hemorrhagic chemosis, unilateral proptosis, with no evidence of uveitis, and normal fundus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbit showed left eye proptosis with inflammation of the extraocular muscle and the periorbital tissue with normal brain and cavernous sinuses. He was treated with high dose steroids (one gram IV methyl prednisone for 3 days) and empiric antibiotics for orbital inflammatory syndrome and an autoimmune and infectious workup was started. His eye symptoms improved on steroids. However, on the third day of hospital admission, he complained of left arm weakness and numbness. A repeat MRI brain showed an interval development of multifocal deep gray nuclei signal abnormalities including diffusion restriction in the caudate nuclei, right globus pallidus, and posterior limb of the internal capsule. His cerebrospinal fluid was essentially normal with 2 white blood cells, normal protein, and glucose with few RBCs. He was empirically started on acyclovir. Within the next 36 hours, he rapidly worsened neurologically, became encephalopathic with left side hemiparesis, and had to be intubated for airway protection. His subsequent MRI brain showed further progression of lesions involving the caudate nuclei, thalami, striatum, and brainstem with new areas of hemorrhage and enhancement. Cerebral arteriogram did not show any vasculitis.
