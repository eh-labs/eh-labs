Oesogastroduodenoscopy was then performed and showed plaques of villus atrophy in the lower duodenum. Histological examination with PAS staining of the duodenal mucosa revealed neither macrophagic infiltration nor the presence of micro-organisms. No PCR was performed on the duodenal biopsies. Given the diagnostic uncertainty and an atypical uveitis with poor evolution, 
an anterior ocular chamber tap was performed. PCR for CMV, HSV1, HSV2, toxoplasma, VZV and EBV on the aqueous humour were all negative.
