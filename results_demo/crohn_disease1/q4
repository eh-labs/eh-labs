Longitudinal incision of the intestine showed a cobblestone appearance, due to linear ulcers crossing with transverse folds. Linear ulcers were created from interconnected rows of aphthous ulcers. A characteristic large pseudopolyp, 4 cm in diameter, was in the obstructed portion of the mass. Microscopically, edema and diffuse inflammation of the whole intestinal wall, fissures, granulomas, vascular dilatation, pseudopolyps, mucosal inflammation of the small and large bowel, and granulomas in local lymph nodes were observed. The tip of the appendix was inflamed too.
