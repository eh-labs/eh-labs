The patient underwent laparotomy and 30 cm of small bowel with multiple areas of damage was found. The damage included macroscopically a rigid and thickened mass in the ileal portion, creeping fat, multiple granulomas in the external intestinal surface and ulcers, two of which had parietal ruptures with fluid escape. A resection of 45 cm of the ileo-jejunal portion, including all areas of intestinal damage, was performed and a primary end to end ileo-jejunal anastomosis completed the operation.
