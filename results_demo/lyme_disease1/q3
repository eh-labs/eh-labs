Her visual acuity was 20/20 right eye and hand motions left eye. The results of ocular examination including tension were normal in the right eye. The left eye showed mild conjunctival ecchymosis and ciliary vessel injection. There was mild periorbital oedema. The ocular rotations were full, though splinting of the left eye was noted in extreme fields of gaze. There was no measurable proptosis. The cornea showed microscopic epithelial oedema with stippled fluorescein staining. There was a severe inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber, with 3+ flare and cells, and a 20% hypopyon was present. After dilatation of the pupil pigment residua were noted on the anterior lens surface from the previously treated posterior synechiae. The lens was otherwise clear. The ocular tension was 18 mmHg. The left fundus could not be seen, and no red reflex was obtained through the cellular debris in the media. Ophthalmic A and B scan ultrasound revealed diffuse debris in the vitreous cavity, with marked thickening of the choroid consistent with a  severe panophthalmitis. The retina was attached.
