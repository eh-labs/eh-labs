Due to the patient’s clinical history of repeated abortions and the results of coagulation studies, other autoantibodies such as anti-thyreoglobulin (1:40) and anti-β2-glicoprotein-1 antibodies (24 UI/mL) were detected. Further characterization of the latter antibodies showed that IgG was 6.3 (normal range < 9) and IgM 48.7 (normal range < 5) IU/mL. All parameters of thyroid function were within the normal range.
