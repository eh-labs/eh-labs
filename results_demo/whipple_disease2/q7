The fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papilloedema, right macular oedema and circular spotty bleeding at the right posterior pole. There was no sign of retinal vasculitis. Under increased doses of imunosuppressive treatment, the patient’s evolution was characterised by thermic lysis, a better general condition, an improvement of arthralgies and a slow decrease in CRP (9,5 mg/dl at the 35th day after admission). However, the ocular symptoms persisted. Different elements led us to reconsider the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease: absence of buccal aphtosis, granulomatous uveitis without vasculitis which does not respond to immunosuppressors, very high inflammatory parameters non consistent with a non-infectious inflammatory disease. The clinical differential diagnosis in the case of our patient, presenting with chronic bilateral uveitis accompanied by sacralgiae and pyrexia is showed in table 2.
