An abnormal fecal occult blood test was identified after a periodic health examination in October 2013. Colonoscopy revealed diffuse inflammation limited to the rectum. Cryptitis, goblet cell depletion, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Results of routine laboratory studies, including a hematology study, liver and kidney function tests, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were normal. There was no increase in the number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Clostridium difficile antigen and toxin were not detected by a rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay. Stool culture did not reveal any pathogen, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella oxytoca. No abnormality was found in a double-contrast barium enema study.
