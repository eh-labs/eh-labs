One week later, 19 days after admission, a lensectomy and vitrectomy were performed and purulent vitreous material was removed. Intravitreal gentamicin 0-2 mg in 0-1 ml and chloramphenicol 0-2 [tg in 0-1 ml were injected and systemic antibiotics were maintained, while systemic steroids were tapered. Cultures and smears for bacteria, fungi, and acid fast organisms were negative, and cytological examination of a fresh vitreous specimen revealed only white cells. One week later a second vitrectomy to remove increasing amounts of vitreous debris was performed. Examination of the material by dark field microscopy was negative for spirochaetes.
