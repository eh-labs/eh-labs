The athlete reported typical gastrointestinal distress (nausea, diarrhea, black and tarry stools, and intestinal cramping), arthralgia, lack of attentional focus, back spasms, and general feelings of malaise. She also had a history of lactose intolerance and suspicious skin rashes and family history of a "wheat allergy" diagnosed in her maternal grandfather at age 90. The athleteâ€™s symptoms started in August 2000, when she began college. Her outward physical appearances were judged normal by the athletic trainers in the athletic medicine facility, aside from a slight painful rash on her back that consisted of reddened papules without drainage.
