A 38-year-old female came to our attention with seven years history of mild microcytic anemia, with recent worsening of her general state, for further investigations and a certain diagnosis establishment. Besides the anemic syndrome, treated repeatedly, but inefficient with oral iron therapy, her additional history revealed non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms "labeled" as irritable bowel syndrome and managed accordingly. The patient stated for intermittent episodes of diarrhea, without warning signs like pus or blood passage in the stool and apparently without a clear trigger for the abdominal disturbances. Diffuse abdominal pain, flatulence and weight loss completed the clinical picture.
